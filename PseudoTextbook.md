# Pseudo Textbook
### an annotated list of useful reading materials for data science, math, and machine learning

#### Neural networks
1. [The Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org), things of note:
    * The introduction gives a good overview of the history and motivation behind neural networks
    * Part 1 helps guide you through necessary mathematical foundations (that are generally useful beyond just neural networks)
    * Part 3, Monte Carlo methods may be useful to look through as well
    * Remaining parts (esp. those concerning the various architectures) may be best skimmed through for ideas, as a hands-on practical approach (e.g. deeplearning.ai) may be more fruitful at first. 
  
2. [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/): Andrew Ng's Coursera course on neural networks
    * Course 3, "Machine Learning Projects", is possibly the most useful for general, practical considerations when trying to solve any data science problem
    * Course 2, "Improving Deep Neural Networks, Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization", is the next useful (again, with respect to practical use of neural networks)
    * The remaining courses give solid foundations for understanding the most popular network architectures
    * Generally, the quizzes are useful to save for future reference when you need to quickly review concepts of neural networks or general practical considerations for solving data problems
  
#### Data science  
1. [Data Science Interview Questions & Detailed Answers](https://rpubs.com/JDAHAN/172473): a cheat sheet of sorts to review common knowledge for data science practitioners
2. [ModeAnalytics](https://modeanalytics.com): a useful resource for learning and honing SQL skills, also has useful case studies
3. Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course on Coursera: basic principles of common / classic machine learning (and incidentally, data analysis) methods, as well as motivation and practical use tips
4. Honing programming skills with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/): the problems you solve are completely irrelevant to data science, but this is a good resource to help you program more efficiently and make robust algorithms.
5. I probably need to add something related to data engineering / data cleaning here, although I feel like these are sometimes secondary to actually solving the data problem / answering the data question. 

#### Useful math / stats / probability concepts
1. [Bayesian inference](https://brohrer.github.io/how_bayesian_inference_works.html): a simple primer
2. [Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) methods, in the context of Bayesian methods: accessible (but deeper) primer on Bayesian methods, with added benefit of learning MCMC
3. [Linear algebra tutorial quickie](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/comprehensive-guide-to-linear-algebra/): if you're short on time and patience, start here. Simple matrix operations (what is a matrix, basic arithmetic) you probably know. But things unique to linear algebra (trace, SVD, inverse, eigenvalues) need to be learned.
4. [Applied math and machine learning basics](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/part_basics.html): ...else if you have time, can bring yourself up to speed with linear algebra and other useful topics here

#### Case studies
i.e. things to help you think about and solve data problems
1. Course 3 from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
2. Some of the questions on the [data science cheat sheet](https://rpubs.com/JDAHAN/172473)
3. [ModeAnalytics' SQL analytics training](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/sql-business-analytics-training/)
